🏰 Mansion Sleepover – Text Adventure Game

📖 Description
This is a classic text-based adventure game set in your uncle's luxurious mansion. Players can explore interconnected rooms, examine ornate objects, and navigate a richly described environment. The game reads room layouts, objects, and exits from an external data file, demonstrating core programming skills such as file I/O, string parsing, data organization, and control flow.

🚀 Features

🗺️ Room Navigation: Explore over 20 lavish rooms, from a grand entrance hall to a hidden laboratory.

🔍 Object Interaction: Examine unique objects to uncover narrative details.

🧠 Command Parser: Supports commands like look, examine <object>, movement directions (e.g., north, secret passage on the south), and exit.

📁 Data-Driven Design: Game world is defined in a structured text file (data.txt), making it easy to expand or modify.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Core programming concepts: functions, lists, tuples, conditionals, loops, and file handling
